### [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

- `Blockchain` is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

- `BFT`(Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - the ability of a network or system to continue functioning even when some components are faulty or have failed. With a BFT system, blockchain networks keep functioning or implementing planned actions as long as most network participants are reliable and genuine.
